## gcmd - AI-powered command generator

A tool that generates and executes bash commands from natural language descriptions using Groq AI.

### Prerequisites:
  1. Install the Groq Python package:
        ```pip install groq```
  2. Set your Groq API key as an environment variable:
        ```export GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here```

### Setup:
  1. Save the script as gcmd.py.
  2. Make it executable:
        ```chmod +x gcmd.py```
  3. Move it to /usr/local/bin for global access:
        ```sudo mv gcmd.py /usr/local/bin/gcmd```

### Usage:
  1. Basic usage (shows command and output):
        ```gcmd "find all PDF files in the current directory"```
  
  2. Quiet mode (for piping):
        ```gcmd -q "find all PDF files in the current directory" | grep "document"```
  
  3. Dry run mode (only shows the command without executing):
        ```gcmd -d "find all PDF files in the current directory"```

Now you can generate and execute commands using natural language! ðŸš€
